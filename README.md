- **Duplicated vertex** >>> This addon will remove all duplicated vertices
- **Inside-out normals** >>> This adon will recalculate all normals to outside
- **Object Scale =/= 1** >>> This addon will Apply all transformations on all axis

Extra feature: Reset origin to mesh center (activate it in the addon itself ;) )

## How to use

After installing this addon, you will find a new button icon **[!]** on the top-right area of the 3D View, you can fix your mesh at any time you suspect it could have an error.

A single mouse click to avoid modelling pain ;)
